# Summer_ANN_Project_Graphs
Graphs from my summer studentship working on artificial neural network (ANNs) at the Centre for Advanced Insturmentation at Durham University.
I built and tested a convolutional neural network that would identify the distortion modes in artificially distrorted generated noise images, with the goal of seeing whether a similar technique could be used for identifying the distortion modes of solar wavefronts that had been distroted by atmospheric turbulence for adaptive optics systems.
This involved finding the optimal architecture and hyperparameters of the network, as well as the ideal images to test/train against to emulate the solar surface whilst avoiding overtraining.
